  We will study the wildfire dataset that is available with many features and 1.88 million records. We are interested in location and time variant visualizations and finding what outcomes could be predicted and with what accuracy.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/data
This dataset is a spatial database capturing wildfire incidents in the US from 1992 to 2015. Each record is geo-referenced with key attributes like discovery date, final fire size, and precise location per the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) standards. Originating from various fire reporting agencies and updated for the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system, this dataset provides a granular view of wildfire trends, making it a robust resource for analytical and visualization projects.

Project goals: Visualize with a heatmap locations of wildfires, and visualize trends over time of average size and count of wildfires
Find the features that most influence the wildfire outcomes
Study wildfire prevalence over time, and see investigate ways to model and predict outcomes such as the size of the wildfire as well as the cause of the wildfire.
